# Battle Cry

## Short description

Combat-oriented Zelda with procedural levels.

## Game Type/Genre

Battle-cry is a dungeon crawler with zelda-inspired gameplay. The levels are procedurally generated. The player must use and improve equipment and habilities in order to survive.

## Scenario

All happened in the blink of an eye. One moment you were living a peaceful life in your village, and the next one you were thrown on these twisted lands.

The stars in the sky are unfamiliar to you. You don't recognize any of the plants you see. The local fauna seems aggresive and dangerous.

You don't know how you got here, but one thing is clear: Your only hope is surviving long enough to find a way back.

You gather the little stuff you have, and prepare for battle.

## Long Description

The game levels will be procedurally generated. Every level will be closed, with only one entry and one exit.

Levels will have the usual architectural details:

- walls, opaque and non-traversable for most creatures
- floor tiles, some of which might have special effects (i.e. lava, ice or chasms)
- doors, which only intelligent creatures will know how to open
- furniture of various sizes and materials
- enemies, of course
- one single entry and one single exit

Levels will be persistent. The amount and type of enemies in a level will be persisted. Their position will not.

Some of the creatures will be neutral to the player. Others will attack on sight.

The creatures will be strange animals in the lower levels. In the middle levels the player will encounter sapient creatures, which will attack with weapons, armor and magic. In the later levels, most enemies will use magic of some sort.

> The golden rule: every creature has to have something special

When possible, favour attack types instead of weaknesses/resistances. For example, favor attacks that can "disarm the player on touch" instead of simply "resist magic"

The player will be able to choose from a tree of dexterities, which would be grouped into 4 types: mage, archer, warrior and paladin.

## Game System

> What rules does the game implement? What objects need to be defined, what events need to be raised, and what actions are fired for each event?
> It may be useful to break the objects down into subcategories - player character, 'non-player characters' (e.g. 'monsters'), room objects (walls, doors), scoring/health objects (treasure, fuel pellets, first aid kits etc.), controller objects etc.


## Narrative Structure

> How is the story structured? Draw the plotline using a graph to show how major story events are connected to each other...

## Game Play

> Describe the mechanics of how the player actually plays the game; include a subsection describing the user controls and how these relate to user actions (keyobard/gamepad controls).

## Room Map

> How are the rooms structured or ordered? Provide a map of the 'physical layout' of game world showing how different physical locations or rooms are ordered and/or connect to each other.

## Title and Information Screens

> Describe the organisation and navigation structures surrounding the 'non-game' pages:the title page, the end game page, the help page, high score page...

## Audio Requirements

> What are the audio requirements of the game? Background music, alert sounds for particular events or actions, general backbround noise?
